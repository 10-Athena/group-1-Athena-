    <h1> A heartfelt journey towards our last Performance Task in AP/ESP </h1>

<p> On the start of April 3, 2024 grade 10 students are given a task to create a 8 verse poem for the upcoming speech choir on April 25, 2024. So as a start we decided as 10 athena to create our own individual verse then combine all of our ideas as one. At first we thought that the created poem was fine, not until our adviser, Ma'am Maura A. Zeta straight up said that it has no direct meaning, all ideas are scattered and no clear finish. We were shocked but we know that she only wants the best for us, therefore she chose  8 specific students to form a new verse for our speech choir. We followed her lead as we realized that her knowledge and  experience are far more greater compare to all of us. On the first week, the chosen 44 participants for the speech choir was put into a lot of pressure, while all propsmen are waiting for instructions about the needed materials. The following weeks, pressure starts to build up as all of our activities on every subject are filling up our time. We still did not avoid getting scolded by our adviser, and yet here we are with no complaints on her guidance, trying our hardest on everyday basis. Until now we are not halfway done, there is still some progress we need to achieve. We may struggle as a group, but we will surely perform as one and do our best to show our appreciation to our adviser who supported us, telling us what's wrong, and what's the right thing to do.</p>
